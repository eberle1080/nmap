This is a patch to show more details when running nmap, particularly about
TTL and filtered states.

I wrote this for my requirements class. I made this guy's dreams come true:

http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q4/287

Seriously, that guy was so happy, he was like, "dude, I'm really happy". Good
for you, man. Glad you like it.
